# Welcome to Central Docs

## Single Source of Truth (SSoT)
The goal of Central Docs is to to establish a single, authoritative source for all policies, procedures, 
and practices across all city repositories and development projects. 

These guidelines are intended to facilitate, rather than restrict, the collaborative development experience, 
and we encourage all involved to discuss, contribute, and improve this documentation.
