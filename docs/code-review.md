# Code Review

The code review is an essential part of our workflow and helps to improve the overall quality
of repositories over time.

By conducting code reviews, we can: 

- Ensure that any proposed change has been vetted by at least two different developers
- Maintain consistent development practices
- Encourage good communication and collaboration between developers
- Learn from each other
